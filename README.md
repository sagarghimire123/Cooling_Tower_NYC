# Cooling_Tower_NYC


This project was about the dataset of DOHMH Cooling Tower taken from NYC open data. A cooling tower is designed to remove heat from a building or facility by spraying water down throw the tower to exchange heat into the inside of the building. Air comes in from the sides of the tower and passes through the water, Cooling towers are primarily used for heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, and industrial purpose. 

The main purpose of this project was to explore and analyze the data set using the visualization method. Various questions were created during the proposal of the project, and they were explained using visualization methods such as bar chart, pie chart, scatter plot, time series, and folium map with markers. The language used for this analysis was Python and various libraries like pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib were used for the project.
