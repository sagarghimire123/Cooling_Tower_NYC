# Cooling_Tower_NYC
This project was about the dataset of DOHMH Cooling Tower taken from NYC open data. Cooling
tower is designed to remove heat from a building or facility by spraying water down throw the
tower to exchange heat into inside of the building. Air comes in from the sides of tower and
passes through the water, Cooling towers are primarily used for the heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning and industrial purpose. 

The main purpose of this project was to explore  and analyze the data set using visualization method.
Various questions were created during the proposal of the project and they were explained using
visualization methods such as bar chart, pie chart, scatter plot, time series and folium map with markers.
The language used for this analysis was Python and various libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib were used for the project.
